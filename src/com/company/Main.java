//        Your job is to create a simple banking application.
//        TIP:  In Bank, use the findBranch() method in each of the other four methods to validate a branch. Do the same thing in Branch with findCustomer() - except for the two getters.
//                TIP:  In Customer, think about what else you need to do in the constructor when you instantiate a Customer object.
//                TIP:  Think about what methods you need to call from another class when implementing a method.
//        TIP:  Be extremely careful with the spelling of the names of the fields, constructors and methods.
//        TIP:  Be extremely careful about spaces and spelling in the printed output.
//                NOTE:  All transactions are deposits (no withdraws/balances).
//        NOTE:  All fields are private.
//        NOTE:  All constructors are public.
//        NOTE:  All methods are public (except for findBranch() and findCustomer() which are private).
//        NOTE:  There are no static members.
//                NOTE:  Do not add a main method to the solution code.
//        NOTE:  If you get an error from the Evaluate class, it's most likely the constructor. Check if you've added a constructor or if the constructor has the right arguments.
